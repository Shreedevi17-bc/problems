simple problem solutions
# üë©‚Äçüíª My Practice Programs

This is a collection of Python and JavaScript programs I wrote for practice.  
These help me learn the basics of coding like conditions, loops, functions, and simple logic.  
Later, I will update each one with **PSP (Problem Solving Paradigm)**.

## üß† My Goal

I am learning step by step.  
These programs help me understand logic and syntax.  
Later, I will:
- Add more real-world examples.
- Follow PSP (Problem Solving Paradigm).
- Build small projects using these basics.

## üöÄ How to Run

- For **Python**: `python filename.py`
- For **JavaScript** (Node.js): `node filename.js`
- Or use browser console for small JS files.
